As a dedicated Web Developer with a strong focus on React, I thrive in environments that challenge my problem-solving skills and allow me to collaborate with diverse teams. I’m passionate about creating high-quality, scalable web solutions, and I take pride in continuously expanding my technical knowledge.

I have experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, including React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, and C#, with a solid background in working with APIs, databases, and modern development practices like test-driven development and debugging.

I enjoy building user-friendly, dynamic websites that offer seamless experiences, and I’m always seeking ways to optimize performance and improve code quality. My journey has taught me the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and communication, which I value as essential skills for a successful developer.

I’m excited to continue learning and growing as part of a team that values innovation and collaboration.
